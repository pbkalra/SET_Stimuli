Introduction to "Set" stimuli

OBJECTS
There are 27 basic "objects" made by the combination of 3 shapes (triangle, circle, square), 3 colors (red, green, blue), and 3 stripe orientations (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal)
(3x3x3=27)

PAIRS
These 27 objects can then be combined into 729 pairs (27x27 = 729).  The pairs are considered in terms of same/different relations between the two objects in the pair: 
same color or not (1/0), same shape or not (1/0), and same stripe orientation or not (1/0).  The pairs can be rated as having 1, 2, or 3 true values for relational properties. 
If all 3 relational properties are true (same color, same shape, same stripe orientation) then the two shapes in the pair are identical.  This is referred to as the RELATIONAL NUMBER.
However, two pairs could have the same relational number but different relational types.  For example, one pair might have same color, different shape, different stripe orientation, 
another has different color, same shape, different stripes--they each have only one "same" relation, but the dimension that is the same is different.  The RELATIONAL TYPE is
denoted by a 3-digit string from 000 (all different) to 111 (all same), where the position refers to the dimension (so same color only might be 100 but same shape only might be 010).
